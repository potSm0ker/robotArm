# Robotic Arm Yahboom 6DOFBOT with Jetson Nano 4gb open source
30,000 foot goal: Create an arm that is a robot and can trim cannabis using open cv or other methods of live video feed object detection
The arm will be able to grasp a branch from a bin full of branches, then hold the branch while a second arm
holding scissor will trim the buds. The finished buds will be dropped into a bucket when complete.
