I am using a Yahboom DOFBOT Robotic Arm with ROS and Jetson NANO 4GB(B01/SUB) purchased from amazon.com
The official documentation for the arm is on github under the: YahboomTechnology/dofbot-jetson_nano   repository
I will list the useful information in this repository, perhaps in a more organized way.

# robotArm
30,000 foot goal: Create an arm that is a robot and can trim cannabis using open cv or other methods of live video feed object detection
The arm will be able to grasp a branch from a bin full of branches, then hold the branch while a second arm
holding scissor will trim the buds. The finished buds will be dropped into a bucket when complete.
