# Trim Bot Project

<details>

<summary> ***30,000 foot goal.*** Create a pair of electric robot arms that can trim 1 pound of dried cannabis buds in 8 hours </summary>

Create a pair of electric robotic arms that can **automatically** trim dried cannabis flowers using a standard pair of trimming scissors. **The target goal is to trim 1 pound of cannabis in 8 hours time.** The arm uses servo motors to rotate the joints. For vision- open cv or other methods of object detection using one or more cameras. The arm will be able to grasp (using a two fingered-claw) a branch or bud from a bin full of branches, then hold the branch while a second arm with standard trimming scissors attached (to the claw) will trim the buds. The finished buds will be dropped into a bucket when complete. The average human trimmer would trim for about 7.2 hours in a standard work day, 1 pound of trimmed cannabis would be the expected minimum after 8 hours. 2 pounds would be a high amount for a human trimmer in a standard 8 hour work day.

I am modifying a Yahboom Robot Arm with Jetson NANO 4GB(SUB) purchased from [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Yahboom-Controlled-Programmable-Robotics-Identity/dp/B09T96PS3S/ref=asc_df_B09T96PS3S/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=647177154660&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9522090457653424090&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9029977&hvtargid=pla-1948863623457&psc=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw-vmkBhBMEiwAlrMeF-Z9-dOB8Xg7fpWzmVdcTm2_Ga3R2E9iPS-FwKbWelSRKJymOayAkxoCRlYQAvD_BwE)

### See [workspaceExamples](https://github.com/potSm0ker/robotArm/tree/main/workspaceExamples) folder for visual definition of bud, branch, fan leaf and other items.

<summary> ****The pair of robot arms should do the following:**** </summary>

- trim = remove all fan leaves using standard trimming [scissors](http://www.chikamasa.com/products/index.cgi?key=27) (see assets for product example photos) I will be using CHIKAMASA B-500SF shears

- Able to grasp a branch or bud with pincer-type end effector(2 finger claw)

- Able to open and close a pair of standard trimming scissors, which will be securely attached to end effector(claw). Scissors will be detachable from claw for cleaning.

- Able to identify a single branch or bud in a bin full of similar items.

- Will need camera for object detection. 
    - using open-cv or other methods. python or c++ maybe used.
    - Yolo v5 is compatible with jetson nano.
- Able to work together as a pair of arms, one will hold the scissors(scissor arm), the other will hold a branch/bud(branch arm).

- Branch arm able to identify fan leaves on bud and coordinate with scissor arm to remove all fan leaves.

- Branch arm able to rotate the bud/branch while scissor arm opens and closes scissors to complete trim.

<summary>My 6-Degree Of Freedom(DOF) yahboom with jetson nano 4gb robotic arm system:</summary>

- Operating System: Ubuntu 18  64bit
- rosdistro: melodic
- rosversion: 1.14.13
- Im using a 17" HDMI monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse plugged into USB on the Jetson Nano, which is plugged into yahboom control board. Use the terminal to run python scripts directly on the robot. This is the easiest way and gives the user complete control over the robot.

- I am modifying an off the shelf robot, and using as many off the shelf parts as possible. I will list the official sites of the parts used in this project.
- The official documentation/code for the arm is @ [6DOFBot-jetson_nano on github](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/dofbot-jetson_nano.git)
- The official website is [yahboom robots](http://www.yahboom.net/home) 
- Here is a link  to a [YouTube playlist- Build a Robot Arm](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcbaYozXcpF65uUvdCmepFYYjx4FZ4Iwq), these videos have info that may assist in completing the goal.
I will store the info I find useful in this repository. Some code maybe generated by chat-gpt or similar methods.
