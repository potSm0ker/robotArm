# YoloV5 custom trained models

These are yolo v5 custom models. Trained for identifying branches, buds, and individual leaves of dried cannabis. 
Photos of cannabis branches that I have physical access to were used to train the models
I used an Ipod to take around 500 images of the cannabis branches. I may update these models in the future.
I used [Ultralytics Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb) to train these models.
