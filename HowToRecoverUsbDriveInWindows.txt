How to recover usb drive in windows after writing an image file to disk

To view the disks, run (press Win+r and type, either find in the Start menu, or run in the command line):


diskmgmt.msc

To fix it, open a command prompt with administrator rights – this can be done by pressing Win+x and selecting Windows Terminal (Admin).


Run the diskpart utility, to do this, in the command line that opens, run:

diskpart

List the disks with the following command:

list disk

now select the disk that needs to be restored, this is done with a command like

select disk X

Where as “X” you need to specify the number of your USB flash drive that you want to restore.

For example, my disk number is 2, then the command is as follows:

select disk 2

The following command cleans up the disk:

clean

One of the most common reasons for this is that the disk is being used in another program, for example, the disk is currently open in the file manager. Close the file manager and other programs that might be using the disk and resubmit the command.

Now create the partition table:

create partition primary

If everything went well, the following message will be displayed:

DiskPart succeeded in creating the specified partition.
