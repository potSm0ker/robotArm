These are scripts that I am using to control the robot and help me complete my goal of creating a pair of autonomous cannabis trimming robot arms.
Some of these scripts may only work on a raspberry pi. In the jetson nano scripts folder are scripts that were developed for jetson nano and yahboom expansion board. I started this project with the jetson nano and expansion board but switched to raspberry pi 4 because it is more user friendly and has a larger community that can provide more answers to questions.
