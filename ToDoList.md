<summary>To Do List</summary>

- Need to create a bigger arm. The yahboom robot is tiny. Can barely pick up a branch from tabletop. I can use possibly to prototype code for later use. The branches can be more than 24 inches long. Arm needs to be able to reach into a bin and move end-effector holding branch above a tray for fan leaf removal.
- Create custom data sets for individual buds and branches.
- The camera will identify the branch closest to the end effector and send the coordinates to the branch arm to pick up and hold. There will be many other branches that look similar and will be close together.
