# Mounting Bracket for the Oak D pro camera from Luxonis

This a 3d printable bracket (for mounting the Oak D-pro camera) made in [blender](https://www.blender.org/) version 3.4  

The Oak d pro is availale at [Luxonis store](https://shop.luxonis.com/products/oak-d-pro?variant=42455252369631)

I have included the blender project file so you can edit as needed and the 3d model file is ready for immediate use
The .stl file is the 3d model and can be sent to a 3d printing service such as https://www.xometry.com 

I created this bracket to mount the camera on a robotic arm system I am developing, I do not work for Luxonis.
