To make the robot arm (with jetson nano 4gb) do what I need to do, it will need some upgrades.
A useful website for [jetson nano hacks](https://www.jetsonhacks.com/)


### Increase storage  SAMSUNG T7 Portable SSD 500GB
 - I used win32disk imager to write the custom jetson image provided by yahboom for the robot arm
 - boot from usb [jetsonhacks.com](https://jetsonhacks.com/2021/03/10/jetson-nano-boot-from-usb/)
 - increase the storage space by copying and mounting the file system to a usb drive of your choice
 - create backups of boot device
 




### Upgrade cooling fan and heat sink
 - I upgraded to [Ice tower cooling fan](https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Low-Profile-Horizontal-Radiator-Colorful/dp/B07ZYW6ZVR/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2GY7QMQU6IJJ&keywords=ice+tower+cooling+fan+jetson+nano&qid=1690327939&sprefix=ice+tower+cooling+fan+jetson+nano%2Caps%2C132&sr=8-3) from amazon.com
