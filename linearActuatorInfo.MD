## info is specific to this particular project, maybe used for other projects
- Needed for this project- slide rail(linear actuator lead screw) with a length of at least, 1000mm (3 feet), to increase reach of the robotic arm
- will be mounted vertically on a wall, with robot arm attached to slide rail on a plate.
-  lead screw-driven actuators with slide rail
- nema23 stepper motor connect to jetson nano
- Digital Stepper Driver 1.0-4.5A 18-50VDC for Nema 17, 23, 24 Stepper Motor $17.88
- for connection  USB to TTL Serial Cable or FTDI Serial TTL-232 USB Cable

 - Connect the motor driver to the Jetson Nano: usb to ttl cable. The motor driver will typically use digital input pins to receive control signals from the Jetson Nano.
